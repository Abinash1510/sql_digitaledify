Task:

1. COMMIT - Successful Transaction
Rahul wants to send ₹5000 to Amit using PhonePe. The amount is deducted from Rahul’s account and credited to Amit’s account successfully.
Write an SQL query to implement this transaction using COMMIT.

2. ROLLBACK - Failed Transaction
Rahul initiates a transfer of ₹5000, but due to a server issue, the amount is deducted from his account but not credited to Amit.
Since the transaction fails, it must be reversed.
Write an SQL query to ROLLBACK the transaction.

3. SAVEPOINT - Partial Rollback
Rahul decides to send ₹5000 in two parts: ₹3000 first and ₹2000 later.
The first transfer of ₹3000 is successful, but the second transfer of ₹2000 fails due to a network issue.
Instead of rolling back the entire transaction, only the failed ₹2000 transfer should be rolled back, and the ₹3000 transfer should remain successful.
Write an SQL query using SAVEPOINT to handle this situation.


Solution:


create database bank;
use bank;

create table accounts(
	  account_id int primary key,
    account_holder_name varchar(81),
    balance int);

insert into accounts(account_id,account_holder_name,balance)values 
								(1,'Rahul', 84000),
                (2, 'Amit', 79000);





-- COMMIT - Successful Transaction
start transaction;                                

update accounts set balance = balance - 5000 where account_id = 1;
update accounts set balance = balance + 5000 where account_id = 2;

commit;

select * from accounts;





-- ROLLBACK - Failed Transaction
start transaction;                                

update accounts set balance = balance - 5000 where account_id = 1;
update accounts set balance = balance + 5000 where account_id = 2;

rollback;





-- SAVEPOINT - Partial Rollback
start transaction;                                

update accounts set balance = balance - 3000 where account_id = 1;
update accounts set balance = balance + 3000 where account_id = 2;

savepoint first_transfer;

update accounts set balance = balance - 2000 where account_id = 1;
update accounts set balance = balance + 2000 where account_id = 2;

rollback to savepoint first_transfer; 

commit;
